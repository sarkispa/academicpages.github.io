My first name is Paul Anthony, my last name is Sarkis (he/his) and I am a fourth year Ph.D. student in Economics at Boston College.

My research interests are in empirical Industrial Organization and Energy Economics (with a touch of computational economics). In particular, I am interested in the modeling and analysis of energy markets and the associated environmental policies. A good example of this is my [_latest accepted paper_](http://www.iaee.org/en/publications/ejarticle.aspx?id=3709). For more about my research, click [_here_](https://sarkispa.github.io/research/).

I am proficient in various programming languages such as Python, Julia and Matlab. I have used many optimization packages such as GAMS or AMPL. I have experience coding IO models and simulations in all those languages. I am also used to work with version-control software such as Git.
