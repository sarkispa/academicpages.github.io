My first name is Paul Anthony, my last name is Sarkis (he/his) and I am a fourth year Ph.D. student in Economics at Boston College.

My research interests are in empirical Industrial Organization and Energy Economics (with a touch of computational economics). In particular, I am interested in the modeling and analysis of markets targeted by environmental policies. A good example of this is my [_latest accepted paper_](http://www.iaee.org/en/publications/ejarticle.aspx?id=3709) where we study the effects of increasing Renewable Energy Sources in concentrated electricity markets. For more about my research, click [_here_](https://sarkispa.github.io/research/).

I am proficient in various programming languages such as Julia, Python and Matlab, although these days I tend to code only in Julia.
