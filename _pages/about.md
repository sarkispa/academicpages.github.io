I am an Economics Ph.D. student at Boston College since August 2017.

My research interests are in empirical Industrial Organization and Energy Economics (with a touch of computational economics). I am interested in particular in the modeling and analysis of energy markets and the associated environmental policies.

I am proficient in various programming languages such as Python, Julia and Matlab. I have used many optimization packages such as GAMS or AMPL. I have experience coding IO models and simulations in all those languages. I am also used to work with version-control software such as Git.
