I am an Economics Ph.D. student at Boston College since August 2017. I expect to graduate in 2022.

My research interests are in empirical and theoretical Industrial Organization (with a touch of computational economics). I am interested in particular in the modeling and analysis of energy markets and environmental policies.

I am proficient in various programming languages such as Python, Julia, Matlab, GAMS, PATH and R: I have experience coding IO models and simulations in all those languages. I am also used to work with version-control software such as Git.
