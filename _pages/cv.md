#### Master's thesis: Competitive Behavior in the Ontario Electricity Generation Market (available here, in French)

The results of my thesis can be divided in two connected parts. First, using IESO data, I find that the perfect competition hypothesis used frequently in models of the Ontario electricity market is a better model if we add a Cournot setting to it, in particular in times of high demand. Second, using this two-model setting, I compute the effects of different environmental policies on the market structure. Policies studied include a potential carbon tax or a natural gas phaseout. Results show that under market power these policies seem less efficient than with perfect competition only.
