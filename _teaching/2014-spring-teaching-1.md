Students will learn a powerful tool to better understand economic environments: the economic way of thinking. By mastering the logical principles of economic thinking, students will be able to anticipate the behavior of economic agents (consumers, producers, workers, investors, but also their future employers and employees!) and, thus, better fulfill tasks in managing positions.

The material is presented through examples, applications and in-class discussions. Students will learn to:
- master the economic language in its various forms: intuitive, graphical and mathematical;
- formulate precise arguments concerning many aspects of economic and daily life;
- identify fallacious reasoning;
- form a critical judgment about assertions encountered in the media;
- reason in terms of incentives, and understand how our environment influences our decision making.
