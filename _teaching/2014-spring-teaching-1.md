Students will learn a powerful tool to better understand economic environments: the economic way of thinking. By mastering the logical principles of economic thinking, students will be able to anticipate the behavior of economic agents (consumers, producers, workers, investors, but also their future employers and employees!) and, thus, better fulfill tasks in managing positions.
